## 📖 About the Project

**SummarAI** is a full-stack web application that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically summarize long-form text — articles, research papers, blog posts, news — into concise, readable summaries.

The project implements **two distinct summarization approaches**:

- **Abstractive** — uses the `facebook/bart-large-cnn` transformer model (fine-tuned on 300,000+ CNN/DailyMail articles) to *understand* the text and write a fresh summary in its own words, just like a human would.
- **Extractive** — uses a custom-built TF-IDF scoring algorithm to identify and return the most statistically important sentences from the original text.

This was built as a beginner-to-intermediate learning project to understand NLP pipelines, REST API design, and full-stack web development — from model inference all the way to a production-ready interface.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher — [Download](https://python.org/downloads)
- pip (bundled with Python)
- ~2GB free disk space (for the BART model cache)
- Git — [Download](https://git-scm.com)

---

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TUSHARTAMRAKAR/Text-Summarizer-Tool.git
cd Text-Summarizer-Tool
```

**2. Create a virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

**3. Activate the virtual environment**

```bash
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

You'll see `(venv)` at the start of your terminal prompt. ✅

**4. Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ⚠️ The first run will download the `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model (~1.6GB).  
> This only happens once — it's cached locally afterwards.

**5. Start the server**

```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

**6. Open in browser**

```
http://localhost:5000
```

The app is running. 🎉

## 🔌 API Reference

Full documentation → [`docs/API.md`](docs/API.md)

Base URL: `http://localhost:5000`

---

### `POST /api/summarize`

Summarize a piece of text.

**Request body:**

```json
{
  "text": "Paste your article text here...",
  "length": "medium",
  "method": "abstractive"
}
```

| Parameter | Type | Options | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `text` | `string` | 50 – 50,000 characters | required |
| `length` | `string` | `short` · `medium` · `long` | `medium` |
| `method` | `string` | `abstractive` · `extractive` | `abstractive` |

**Success response `200`:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "summary": "Artificial intelligence is reshaping industries worldwide...",
  "original_word_count": 500,
  "summary_word_count": 82,
  "compression_ratio": "84%",
  "method_used": "abstractive"
}
```

**Error response `400`:**

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Text is too short. Please provide at least 50 characters."
}
```

---

### `GET /api/health`

Returns server and model status.

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "model_loaded": true,
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

---

### `GET /api/sample`

Returns a built-in demo article for testing.

## 🧠 How It Works

### Abstractive Summarization (BART Transformer)

```
Your Text
    ↓
BART Encoder  →  Reads and builds deep understanding of the text
    ↓
BART Decoder  →  Generates a brand new summary, word by word
    ↓
Fresh Summary (written in the model's own words)
```

BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer) was fine-tuned by Facebook AI on the CNN/DailyMail dataset — 300,000+ news articles with human-written summaries. It learns to compress information the same way a journalist would.

---

### Extractive Summarization (TF-IDF)

```
Your Text
    ↓
Split into individual sentences
    ↓
Score each sentence using TF-IDF weights
(words rare in the document but frequent in the sentence = more important)
    ↓
Rank sentences by score
    ↓
Return top N sentences in original order
```

**TF-IDF** = Term Frequency × Inverse Document Frequency. It mathematically identifies which words — and therefore which sentences — carry the most unique information in the document. No AI model needed, works fully offline, instant results.
